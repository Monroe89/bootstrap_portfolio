                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas where I graduated from Alamo Heights High School. After high school I attended Texas Tech University where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Restaurant, Hotel, and Institutional Management! During school I spent time in restaurants as well as the food and beverage departments for hotels and resorts. After graduation I worked in management with Enterprise Rent-A-Car for a few years before deciding to move into the technology field.

                        The technology field has always been extremely exciting for me. From video games to computer programs(mostly a variety of sound and video editing) to digital media, it has always been a huge passion of mine. While I make my move into the technology field it's extremely important for me to create and begin to build a portfolio that shows a solid foundation as well as my aptitude and excitement for development and design!

                        Aside from the technology field I am also a huge fan of sports(Wreck 'Em Tech, Go Astros, and Go Spurs Go!), music, and the spending time outdoors! The picture of me was taken on a hike near my family's home in Sundance, Utah. The elevation at Mirror Lake is over 10,000 feet!
