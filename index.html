                            I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas where I graduated from Alamo Heights High School. After high school I attended Texas Tech University where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Restaurant, Hotel, and Institutional Management! After graduation I worked in management with Enterprise Rent-A-Car for a few years before deciding to move into the technology field.

                            The technology field has always been extremely exciting for me. From video games to computer programs(mostly a variety of sound and video editing) to digital media, it has always been a huge passion of mine. While I make my move into the technology field it's extremely important for me to create and begin to build a portfolio that shows a solid foundation as well as my aptitude and excitement for development and design!
